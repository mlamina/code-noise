This project allows developers to explore and iterate on an idea fast 
using PR Pilot in order to get a working prototype quickly.

## Development Target
Some details on the desired state of this prototype:

### User Story
We website that generates / plays background noise for programmers, customizable with sliders and knobs

### Problem Statement
As a programmer, I don't want to listen to music because it is too distracting

### Scope of the prototype
- Noise is generated in the browser
- Pink, white and brown noise are available
- A select number of youtube videos for ambience can be played as well
- All sounds can be mixed together using sliders
- Users can easily share their settings with others

## Project Setup
This is a webapp that uses:
- Python & FastAPI for the backend in `app.py`
- Jinja2 templates stored in `templates/`
- BulmaCSS for styling
- jQuery for JavaScript functionality
- PostgreSQL for data storage using SQLAlchemy and Alembic
- docker-compose for running the app and PostgreSQL

## Structure
There is a `base.html.jinja2` template that is inherited by every page,
with an initial, empty `index.html.jinja2` template being served at the root path (`/`).
