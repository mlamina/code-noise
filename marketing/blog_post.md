# Blog Post: Introducing Code Noise

## The Problem
As a programmer, finding the right environment to focus can be challenging. Music can be too distracting, and complete silence can be unsettling. Many of us need a certain level of ambient noise to get into the zone and maintain deep focus.

## The Solution: Code Noise
Enter [Code Noise](https://code-noise.vercel.app), a web app designed to generate customizable background noise specifically for programmers. Whether you prefer the gentle hum of a coffee shop, the soothing sound of rain, or a mix of white noise, Code Noise allows you to create the perfect auditory environment for your coding sessions.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Noise Parameters:** Adjust sliders to fine-tune the background noise to your liking.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design makes it easy to create your ideal soundscape.
- **Web-Based:** No need to download or install anything. Access Code Noise directly from your browser.

## How It Works
Code Noise is built using Python and FastAPI for the backend, with Jinja2 templates for the frontend. The app uses BulmaCSS for styling and jQuery for JavaScript functionality. MongoDB is used for data storage, and the entire app runs smoothly with the help of Docker and docker-compose.

## Why I Built It
I'm Marco Lamina, and I'm particularly sensitive to sound. I needed an easy way to create the perfect ambience for deep work, and that's why I built Code Noise. It's been a game-changer for me, and I hope it can help other programmers enhance their productivity as well.
