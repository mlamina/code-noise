## Questions
### 1. What is the product?
Code Noise is a web app that generates customizable background noise for programmers. It allows users to adjust noise parameters with sliders to create their ideal work environment.

### 2. Why did you build it?
I'm particularly sensitive to sound and needed an easy way to create the perfect ambience for deep work. Music was too distracting, and complete silence was unsettling, so I built Code Noise to help myself and other programmers enhance their productivity.

### 3. How does it work?
Code Noise is built using Python and FastAPI for the backend, with Jinja2 templates for the frontend. The app uses BulmaCSS for styling and jQuery for JavaScript functionality. MongoDB is used for data storage, and the entire app runs smoothly with the help of Docker and docker-compose. Users can access the app directly from their browser and adjust the noise parameters using sliders.

### 4. What are the key features?
- Customizable Noise Parameters: Adjust sliders to fine-tune the background noise to your liking.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design makes it easy to create your ideal soundscape.
- Web-Based: No need to download or install anything. Access Code Noise directly from your browser.

### 5. Whatâ€™s next?
I plan to gather user feedback and continue improving the app based on their suggestions. Future updates may include additional noise options and more advanced customization features.
