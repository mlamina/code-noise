Show HN: Code Noise - Customizable Background Noise Generator for Programmers

## Description

Hi HN,

I'm excited to share [Code Noise](https://code-noise.vercel.app), a web app I built to help programmers stay focused and productive. It generates customizable background noise, including pink, white, and brown noise, and lets you mix in YouTube videos for the perfect coding environment. As a sound-sensitive programmer, I found music too distracting, so I created this tool to help others like me. Check it out and let me know your thoughts!
