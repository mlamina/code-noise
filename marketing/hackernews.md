**Title:** Introducing Code Noise: Customizable Background Noise for Programmers

**Description:**
As a programmer, finding the right environment to focus can be challenging. Music can be too distracting, and complete silence can be unsettling. That's why I built [Code Noise](https://code-noise.vercel.app), a web app that generates customizable background noise specifically for programmers. Adjust the noise parameters with sliders to create your perfect work environment. Check it out and let me know what you think!
