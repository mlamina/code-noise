ðŸŽ§ **Introducing Code Noise!** As a programmer, I often find music too distracting while coding. That's why I built [Code Noise](https://code-noise.vercel.app), a web app that generates customizable background noise to help you stay focused and productive. Mix pink, white, and brown noise, and even add YouTube videos for the perfect coding environment. Try it out and enhance your workflow today!
