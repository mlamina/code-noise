I recently built a web app called [Code Noise](https://code-noise.vercel.app) that generates customizable background noise for programmers. As someone who's sensitive to sound, I needed an easy way to create the perfect ambience for deep work. You can adjust the noise parameters with sliders to find your ideal focus environment. Check it out and let me know what you think!
