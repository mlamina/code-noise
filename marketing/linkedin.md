ðŸš€ Excited to introduce Code Noise! As a programmer, I often find music too distracting while coding. That's why I built [Code Noise](https://code-noise.vercel.app), a web app that generates customizable background noise to help you stay focused and productive. You can mix pink, white, and brown noise, and even add YouTube videos for the perfect coding environment. Check it out and let me know what you think! #Coding #Productivity #WebDevelopment #Focus
