# 🎧 Introducing Code Noise: Your Ultimate Background Noise Generator for Programmers! 🚀

Hey Dev.to community! 👋

I'm **Marco Lamina**, and I'm super excited to share a project I've been working on: [**Code Noise**](https://code-noise.vercel.app)! 🌟

## Why I Built It

As a programmer, I'm very **sound sensitive** and often find music too distracting while coding. I wanted a tool where I could create the **perfect background noise** to help me focus. That's how **Code Noise** was born! 🎉

## What is Code Noise?

**Code Noise** is a web app that allows you to generate and play various types of background noise, customizable with sliders and knobs. Whether you prefer **pink, white, or brown noise**, or even a select number of **YouTube videos for ambience**, Code Noise has got you covered! 🎶

## Key Features

- **Noise Generation in the Browser**: No need to download anything!
- **Multiple Noise Types**: Choose from pink, white, and brown noise.
- **YouTube Ambience**: Play a select number of YouTube videos for that perfect background vibe.
- **Customizable Mixing**: Mix all sounds together using intuitive sliders.
- **Share Your Settings**: Easily share your perfect noise settings with others.

## How It Works

The app is built using **Python & FastAPI** for the backend, with **Jinja2 templates** for rendering. We use **BulmaCSS** for styling and **jQuery** for JavaScript functionality. All your settings are stored in **MongoDB**, and the app runs smoothly using **docker-compose**. 🛠️
