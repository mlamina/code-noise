ðŸŽ§ **Introducing Code Noise: The Perfect Background Noise Generator for Programmers** ðŸŽ§

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on: [Code Noise](https://code-noise.vercel.app). As a programmer, I often find music too distracting while coding. That's why I built Code Noise, a web app that generates customizable background noise to help you stay focused and productive.

### The Problem

Many programmers struggle with finding the right background noise that helps them concentrate without being too distracting. Music can often be too engaging, leading to decreased productivity. That's where Code Noise comes in.

### The Solution

Code Noise allows you to create the perfect background noise mix for your coding sessions. You can choose from pink, white, and brown noise, and even add YouTube videos for ambience. The app provides sliders to mix these sounds to your liking, creating a personalized sound environment that enhances your focus.

### Key Features

- **Customizable Noise:** Mix pink, white, and brown noise to create your ideal background sound.
- **YouTube Integration:** Add a select number of YouTube videos for ambient sounds.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use sliders and knobs to adjust the sound mix.
- **Shareable Settings:** Easily share your noise settings with others.

### How It Works

Code Noise is built using Python and FastAPI for the backend, with Jinja2 templates for the frontend. The app uses BulmaCSS for styling and jQuery for JavaScript functionality. MongoDB is used for data storage, and the app runs using docker-compose.

If you're a programmer looking for the perfect background noise to enhance your focus and productivity, give [Code Noise](https://code-noise.vercel.app) a try. I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
